abstract = {Today, at the low end of the communication protocols we fi nd the inter-integrated circuit (I2C) and the serial peripheral interface (SPI) protocols. Both protocols are well suited for communications between integrated circuits for slow communication with on-board peripherals. The two protocols coexist in modern digital electronics systems, and they probably will continue to compete in the future, as both I2C and SPI are actually quite complementary for this kind of communication. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

@article{Richards2002,
abstract = {Many network protocols are described using the seven layer Open System Interconnection (OSI) model, as shown in Figure 1. The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol defines the Data Link Layer and part of thePhysical Layer in the OSI model. The remaining physical layer (and all of the higher layers) are not defined by the CAN specification. These other layers can either be defined by the system designer, or they can be implemented using existing non-proprietary Higher Layer Protocols (HLPs) and physical layers.},

@article{Bosch1991,
abstract = {The acceptance and introduction of serial communication to more and more applications has led to requirements that the assignment of message identifiers to communication functions be standardized for certain applications. These applications can be realized with CAN more comfortably, if the address range that originally has been defined by 11 identifier bits is enlarged Therefore a second message format ('extended format') is introduced that provides a larger address range defined by 29 bits. This will relieve the system designer from compromises with respect to defining well-structured naming schemes. Users of CAN who do not need the identifier range offered by the extended format, can rely on the conventional 11 bit identifier range ('standard format') further on. In this case they can make use of the CAN implementations that are already available on the market, or of new controllers that implement both formats. In order to distinguish standard and extended format the first reserved bit of the CAN message format, as it is defined in CAN Specification 1.2, is used. This is done in such a way that the message format in CAN Specification 1.2 is equivalent to the standard format and therefore is still valid. Furthermore, the extended format has been defined so that messages in standard format and extended format can coexist within the same network. This CAN Specification consists of two parts, with • Part A describing the CAN message format as it is defined in CAN Specification 1.2; • Part B describing both standard and extended message formats. In order to be compatible with this CAN Specification 2.0 it is required that a CAN implementation be compatible with either Part A or Part B.},
